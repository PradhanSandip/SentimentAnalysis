0	This movie is okay, but, its not worth what they're charging so just rent  it. You'll most likely have no desire to see it again. The only good part  is the naked locker room scene with the jocks.	neg
1	This is a great classic collection, if you like these movies and do not have them on dvd this is the set to get. Probably not worth it if you already have them all on dvd.	pos
2	"Despite the sticker hailing ""all new digital restoration"" this edition is no different from previous offerings- all the edge enhancement is stilll there. Stick with the superbit version"	neu
3	i would like to see Will show his true acting skills as opposed to doing the jive Eddie Murphy routine.fast talk with little substance.Tommy Lee Jones is a solid actor.i believe they can do way better than this film.	neu
4	Until I watched this, I didn&#8217;t know that there was a Desert Fox. I liked the acting very much and the story was pretty much the actual thing. This makes for good watching and keeps ones interest up.	pos
5	I am forever amazed at the quality of the television programs coming out of England. Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs are two great programs. I am now starting to buy other programs with the same result - superb programs that are a delight to watch!	pos
6	Although criticised for its dubious inaccuracies, the movie is good to watch and is of the sixties epic style.Two great actors in Anthony Quinn and Oliver Reed are enough to put it into that category.	pos
7	The Bottom Line:A dated and irrelevant rock opera version of the end of Jesus's life, Jesus Christ Superstar features a couple of catchy tunes but mainly just feels long and loud.	neu
8	I really enjoy being able to see these shows, from my childhood, not only on a much bigger TV screen, but also on Blu-ray! I was not disappointed.  Mrs. Ann Z.	pos
9	You can never go wrong when you learn about our country and how things began and the people behind our great country, if you want to learn and be amazed at how it all began then buy this series.	pos
10	I run an in home daycare and try to find fun vidoes for the children, I must admit I even thought this was cute, not too often I can say that.  Thanks	pos

12	How does one rate a movie, it is spectacular, like every other time I've watched it.	pos
13	Why does this movie suck this bad!this movie is dull and has no storyline.FACE THE FACTS.	neg
14	This continuation of the series was most welcomed.  I only watched parts here and there of the original series.  Great!	pos
15	movie was awesome loved it what i could get from it cause i got it looking perfect but the movie skipped like half way wtf man but i loved what i saw pac was great:)	pos
16	Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.	pos
17	There seems to be many versions of this film and this one is equal in interest and quality to any other ones.  Well made with a good ending that is slightly better than the others.	pos
18	Must have bought the wrong DVD.  Many songs were left out.  Much of the original was left out.  Bad mistake.	neg
19	I watched this great Disney movie as a child and was hooked ever since!  The screwball antics of these church ladies is shocking and funny! &quot;Roll Out The Barrel!&quot;	pos
20	who can pass on this great cast of actors and actresses in a story of intrigue and pandemonium inside a group of church ladies.	pos
21	Love Sally Potter films, this is my favorite!  The dancing is absolutely incredible, the story sad at times, but wonderful	pos
22	If you like brain teasers where you cannot point to the murderer within the first 30 minutes this is a good movie for you!  Daniel Craig is great in this early movie role.	pos
23	How is it the 40th anniversary collection of this Masterpiece classic does not have subtitles for the hearing-impaired? This show deserves a 6 star rating, but the subtitles are MISSING.	pos
24	Love the way this simple mom challenges her sons to something better than watching TV everyday by sending them the library. This famous surgeon with such humble beginnings is steered into his destiny through a God fearing mother. Amazing true story.	pos
25	Dune has to be on the list of one of the worst movies ever made.I wouldn't accept this movie if someone paid me to take it.	neg
26	DVD was not compatible with my player. I don't know how to rate it. Ihate the fact that I couldn't use it.	neg
27	Very powerful message and it gives hope. Strong stuff, very insightful and very detailed powerful film of all times.	pos
28	It really does. OK, it was filmed forty years ago, so the odd wobbly wall etc, but if you don't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human.	pos
29	I have to quit comparing it to Downton Abbey!  I like Downton Abbey alot more, but this show is pretty awesome too.  I love these shows in this time era!	pos
30	This movie is so mean I can't believe it was ever made !!!	neg
31	I had this workout video on VHS tape and had forgotten just how much fun and challenging it is.  It was so much fun, the 50 minuts of workout felt more like 1/2 hour and I broke out in a sweat.	pos
32	I was disappointed that Season 3 is not with CC, because I am hearing impaired.  Otherwise I am comparing it to Downton Abbey and up against this is does not come close to be upper successful	pos
33	CinderElmo is so funny!  I laugh at the comedy and my 20 month old daughter dances to the music.  We both love it!	pos
34	I love this show and now I have complied the entire set.  I hate that TV always gets rid of the &#34;good&#34; showes	pos
35	Two hours of a man being brutally tortured, and all to serve the agenda of a director who's gone off the rails. And this dreck made a ton of money at the theatres?	neg
36	A brilliantly made film. Photography, score, settings, acting--all perfection. The problem is that within ten minutes, one can easily predict who the killer is.	neu
37	I know so many people who love this movie that I decided to give it a try.  I found it so boring that I actually fell asleep during it.	neg
38	Save your money and time.Just say no to this disaster of a movie	neg
39	This group of programs might be a tad older but it was still enjoyable to watch. History and Science are timeless such that I'd come back again to watch this.	pos
40	I totally loved this revamp of the the series! Superb acting!I could watch ten more seasons!!!A must see for Downton Abbey lovers too!	pos
41	This plotless sequel is a disappointing let-down from the well-constructed and believable JURASSIC PARK.  It depends on violent special effects as an excuse for being.  The only bright spot is Jeff Goldblum's acting.	neg
42	This show should never have gone out of reruns. The DVD arrived on time and in good condition.	pos
43	Brutally awful film that takes delight in poor taste and sadistic treatment of it's characters. Hardly groundbreaking, animation is ugly and cheap looking. There is nothing redeeming about this film and you can do a lot better.	neg
44	This Film Change My Life In A Better Way , Try To Wach Very Carefully And Try To Understand Why Mel Made This Movie	pos
45	I am just not too much of a fan of social interaction movies. As a comedy, this is a fair movie. But for a war movie, this movie lacks action. Women should like this movie much better though.	neu
46	The first film in which Michael J Fox got full credit as Michael Fox (he's SO young!). This is a great entertaining Disney film that keeps you laughing with good old fashioned fun.	pos
47	I loved this series when it was on television, I've wanted the dvd's since they were released, too pricey.. Now with a great price I bought them. Very happy.	pos
48	This film assumes to be satricial and comedic. However, the inaccuracies in the relating of history and theological doctrine overwhelm any statement or humor this movie attempts to portray.	neu
49	Sorry to report that this item is not as described when I purchased it.  I was expecting dvd format but received vhs instead.	neg
50	Great movies; classics at this point as hard as that is to believe. Gives you a merry feeling. I would surely recommend these movies to anyone.	pos
51	these types of movies are awesome to watch durring christmas time with the family!!! and also this combo is hard to find in stores!! this item especially on bluray was great to find here on amazon!!	pos
52	Symbolic, Hypnotic, Sense savory film on life as a literal book of art!	pos
53	a very disturbing, depressing view of the future.  i would recommend against watching it.  and i like sci fi and like sci fi when it has warnings about the future.	neg
54	Well portrayed and very understandable.  Liked Bruce Marchiano as Jesus. I Would reccommend this movie to my friends, relatives and Christians.	pos
55	Some friends mentioned that they really thought this was funny, but I found it just goofy and not really funny.	neu
56	Wouldn't work in my player.  Returned it for a refund.  Can't understand why it wouldn't play.  Disappointed.  Know the story and was looking forward to seeing this version.	neg
57	The first movie was by far the best.  The second almost equally fun.  The third not so much, but it is a great collection to have.Especially now that it is available in the superior quality blu-ray format.	neu
58	this movie should have flopped. i expected funnieness in it and i did get some unintentiontal laughs at rose mc gowan. dont watch this its absolutley horrid.	neg
59	... that was my reaction to the English dubbed version... It was what I recalled from Saturday afternoon TV as a kid.The original Japanese is better, of course. I like watching foreign films with subtitles, though. It just conveys the feel better.	pos
60	A great acting job by Henry Winkler. I saw this many years ago and it'll always be a Christmas favorite.	pos
61	Kim Novak does fine work here, as usual, but the entire story is way too far-fetched to be believable.Movie is overrated.And that ending? Come on. Really?Pfffft.	neg
62	This series is very well produced, and very informative. The graphics are excellent, and the narrative is well presented. Highly recommend for family viewing.	pos
63	Great set if you're only a fan of the first two movies! I grew up with these and it is truly Christmas when I put these on.	pos
64	A new family in the old London house.  Late '30's run up to WWII.  Good attention to history and detail.  Engaging characters.  Sincerely hope there is a 2nd Season.	pos
65	It take a long time to down load, I t looks like great story from what seen of the movie. It arrived on time, but I wished I could view this movie in full length.	neu
66	excellent cast in this most delightful of Mozart operas- conducted by karajan and with feruccio furlanetti (leporello) as don giovanni's (samuel ramey) counterpoint	pos
67	This was a little slow...the story line was just okay..Sometimes I think there should be more to the story line..	neu
68	I finally found a collection of most or Mel's movies...except Spaceballs....I wonder why this was not included...copyright legal issues maybe?	neu
69	Wuthering Heights can be a little confusing. I found this version easier to follow and the characters easier to understand. Very good effort.	pos
70	I can't believe people actually enjoyed this movie. This movie is so bad I'm not even going to give my usual in depth analysis. It doesn't even deserve it...	neg
71	I din't expect to like this movie, but I did.  I especially enjoyed the documentary of the movie with the actors and other historical film professionals.	pos
72	I enjoyed this version of the Emma saga ! It was acted so well, and I prefer this one over several others I have viewed.	pos
73	Far better that the way I remember watching it as a child, and while I didn't realize it at the time, it did shape my world view a bit.	pos
74	Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I teach American History in Junior High and the action was great to hold their attention while they learned history!	pos
75	This is a very enjoyable TV Series, One you can pick up and watch again.  I have watched it more than once.	pos
76	"A team of movie producers must have come together and said to each other, ""Instead of making a movie that is actually entertaining, why don't we see how many ways can we find to disgust, bore, and depress the viewers?"""	neg
78	"One of the most inspirational stories I've read to date.  Too bad this isn't made ""required reading"" for our schools.  There is no telling how many young lives it would mold into becoming the best they can become in life."	pos
79	I grew up watching these every Thanksgiving with my cousins and brother. Doesnt seem the same without watching these. Great movies. Classics.	pos
80	This is an entertaining film with actors well-suited for their parts.  Our whole family enjoyed it.	pos
81	This complete series starts in 1903 and ends in 1920, featuring a family who lived in a great house in England ~ the lives of the people living upstairs and the completely different lives of those who lived below stairs.	neu
82	Do you think that Mel Brooks has directed some good movies?  Then this is an amazing set of movies, I just need the time to watch them all.	pos
83	My all time favorite christmas movies! Grew up watching them as a kid and I still can't get enough! I love it!	pos
84	the writing and acting is so poor compared to the new hit show, Downton Abbey. I suppose back when it was on, it was ok, but nothing like Downton Abbey!	neg
85	DC in the early days.It's not difficult to see why he was chosen as the new Jams Bond.. Enjoyed this DVD.	pos
86	one of the best commedie movies made by him i love them all blazing saddles was the best bring more.	pos
87	I just love old classics. These are the movies of all movies.  Just love old classics. I love the actors and actresses back then.	pos
88	This sequel was watchable and entertaining, but fell short of the original. I will say the production values are much better, since the original was done in the '70's. I'd recommend it to friends, though.	pos
89	Kathy Smith has always amazed me with her hard workouts that she makes fun and energizing.	pos
90	The resolution of this DVD is very, very poor ! Even a VHS is better than  that. If you want to convince someone not to buy DVD, just show him (her)  this DVD !  END	neg
91	Passion Of The Christ/ Brave Heart. What a creation from Mr. Gibson. I will keep my review very short in order. If there was a way to rate it beyond Five stars I would do in a beet-off my heart. Big cheers to you.	pos
92	I saw this movie 11 times in the theater and I think that this is one of the best movies ever made and the best movie made about Christ and his Passion. God bless all those responsible for the creation of this powerful film.	pos
93	religion department at my school is pleased to be able to show this re-cut version of the film!	pos
94	This is a good movie but the subject is very painful to me... Very well done.. I was concerned that I could get thru it again.	pos
95	Three hours of a man being beaten, and whiped, and god knows what else. No character development, no message, just brutality. Only a sadist would go to this film.	neg
96	dont even bother, unless you're just in it for the fashion and score (some nice techno sounds).	neg
97	Gave as a gift and he loved it and didn't know it was anything like this. It was easy to find and it came when you said.	pos
98	A colorful view of WWII. Mostly have only seen black and white WWII - this gives it a new depth.  I would recommend.	pos
