0	This movie is okay, but, its not worth what they're charging so just rent  it. You'll most likely have no desire to see it again. The only good part  is the naked locker room scene with the jocks.	neg
1	If you love the Highlander 1 movie and the series (except for the very boring Raven series) then do not watch Highlander III don't get this &quot;self contained story&quot; theory of this movie.  They should've just called it something else entirely and simply made a standalone scifi movie.  Instead the suits nearly sunk the Highlander franchise by trying to ride a cult cash wave started by the first movie.Even if it was a standalone movie, it would still stink.  The crappy looking anti-gravity surfboard fight scene made me want to turn off the TV.The magic of the concept of the Immortals is lost when they become simply long-lived aliens. (wow, writing that re-reminds me of how bad this movie is).  The mystique of not quite knowing what the Immortals are is what made the first movie (and the series) so great.  Are they angels?  Mutants?  You never quite know and you don't need to know.Avoid this movie; don't give the suits the satisfaction of making another red cent on sales of this movie.  I'm glad I borrowed my friends' copy instead of paying for even rental of this tripe.  (sorry if any of you likes tripe ;)	neg
2	This is a great classic collection, if you like these movies and do not have them on dvd this is the set to get. Probably not worth it if you already have them all on dvd.	neu
3	"This is the second of John Ford and John Wayne's cavalry trilogy (Fort Apache and Rio Grande are the other two). The yellow ribbon in the title refers to a tradition that the girls would wear a yellow ribbon to indicate that they were faithful to a lover in the cavalry. But the girl in the story manages to get three men to each believe the ribbon is for him. Neat trick, the little hussy!Anyway, John Wayne plays an officer who is one week away from retirement as the movie opens. He was actually pretty young at the time, but the makeup people did such a credible job that he really looks like he really did look when he got old -- except, as I recall, he was heavier than in this movie.The movie opens with a narrator who says ""Custer is dead."" This was the news of the day, and the Indians are teaming up, all the different tribes -- at least the young warriors -- to fight the white man, because the buffalo came back as Custer died, so they figured it was a sign from the Great Spirit. You know, when these religious fanatics take a notion . . .Anyway, the thing is a pretty typical cavalry versus Indians, with Wayne taking time out to talk to an old friend, one of the chiefs, who explains that he cannot control the young bucks because they don't listen to him anymore, since they got this sign from the Great Spirit. Nevertheless, Wayne and his soldiers (in the last hour or so of his command) stampede the Indian's horses right through their village and so make it impossible for them to make war.Frankly, I don't believe it. I love John Wayne, but this was a very boring movie."	test
4	"I am an evangelical Christian who believes in the traditional Christian creed (Jesus is Son of God, etc...).However, I didn't rush out and see this film in theaters.  I only saw it a few days ago for the first time.  While I think that for Christians there is a fair amount here that should cause you to stop and think and ruminate about Christ's suffering, mostly I was just annoyed watching it.I felt the performances were largely contrived (I don't count Jim C, I thought he was fine, if a bit too ""traditional"" in his portrayal).  The actors were OK I guess, but I think Mel's direction was overwrought or something.  Mary and Mary and John didn't have much impact the way the film was structured.  I thought the actors portraying the Romans, with a few exceptions, were terrible.  What was up with the Judas and the constant nose rubbing?  I haven't read through the gospels in awhile, but I don't recall that being in there.Basically kind of mixed bag, really.  I'd have rather spent an extra 30 minutes at the end of the film going over the resurrection and Jesus' appearance to the disciples.  We could've lost at least a few minutes of flogging and maybe had a bit more resurrection in there..."	neg
5	Federal law, in one of its numerous unfunded mandates, in effect orders enterprises large and small to keep ill people in their employ and thus pay for their medical bills. That's the law, so be it. It could make for an interesting courtroom drama as a top legal firm defends itself against violating this law when it dismissed an attorney who concealed his AIDS infection. But what the movie does is politicize the case by using it to denounce the US as homophobic, racist, and oligarchic, plus sentimentalize a homosexual who did not protect himself against AIDS. I see the resulting movie as a cheap exploitation of the subject, with theatrics in the courthouse and lots of schmalz elsewhere.	test
6	"**SPOILER ALERT**I'll bet just about everybody has seen ""Frosty the Snowman"" at one time or another, and I can see why it's a classic. The animation may not exactly be top-notch (let's face it, Disney's animation was far much better; even in those days), but that's not really what matters. What really matters is the music, the acting, and the story behind the animation.It's the day before Christmas, and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman. After some debating, they all agree on the name ""Frosty"". They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle, who is just about the worst magician in the world. (He can't even perform a simple card trick, or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat.) The very second the hat touches Frosty's head, the snowman instantly comes to life. When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all, he decides he wants the hat back. The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend, but when the temperature starts creeping up, Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt. And what better place to not melt than the North Pole?So, the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station, and he and one of the children (a small girl named Karen) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north. Now, a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in--but only if one is a snowman. For Karen, who is made of human flesh, it doesn't take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold. Frosty knows that Karen can't stay in the car for much longer, so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they're out of the car, it still does not do Karen any good, for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness, where it is bitterly cold. Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out--someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death, and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle. Hocus Pocus (Professor Hinkle's pet rabbit, who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them. But Santa doesn't show up until nightfall, and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives, Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle, who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip, Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse, where a whole bunch of poinsettas (tropical Christmas flowers) are growing. Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse, Frosty carries Karen inside. Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse, and Frosty assures her that he'll only stay inside for a minute. But once they're inside, Professor Hinkle, who by then has caught up with them, shuts the door behind them and locks it. Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up, and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen. While searching for the two of them, Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse--the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped. Santa quickly unlocks the door, but once he gets inside, a terrible sight meets his eyes: Karen is down on her knees, crying her eyes out, and all that's left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor. Everything looks hopeless at the moment, as you can very well imagine. Santa, however, assures Karen that all is not lost. He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good; for he is made out of Christmas snow, and Christmas snow can never disappear completely. When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend, Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat, Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there. Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty, and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat, otherwise he'll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life. This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard, and he complains bitterly that it's not fair, for even evil magicians have to make a living. Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write ""I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty"" a hundred zillion times, and then maybe (just maybe) he'll find something in his stocking the following morning. Professor Hinkle agrees, and takes off for home as fast as he can, so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over. Santa then places the hat on Frosty's head, and he immediately awakens, much to Karen's delight. Later, Santa takes Karen home, and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole. Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty, but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas, and so he does. And every year from then on, Frosty's return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I've watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. It's really an awesome movie, one that the whole family can enjoy. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so. It's a real holiday treat."	test
7	I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed....	test
8	This ridiculous premise seems much more suited for a modern B-movie than a classic. I cant believe Stewart accepted such a silly script. Lemmon is as good as can be expected and the only redeeming part is when Kim becomes human. woops! did i just give it away?! no matter, there are far better love stories to see. Lastly something must be said about her brows! I understand shes a witch but theyre so huge and distracting throughout, her beauty is completely overshadowed.	test
9	Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of &#34;An American Christmas Carol.&#34;  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.  Ayyyyy!	neg
10	"Denzel Washington is probably my favorite actor. Even in that dog of a movie called THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, he shone. Tom Hanks? Well, lemme quit hating the guy. This is a well-intentioned movie, Tom did a creditable job, and we had extreme close-ups with funny colors to camouflage the spots where he overreached. I was also pleasantly surprised to see Antonio Banderas fly in the face of his Latino studliness by playing a gay guy. A passionate one, though, since he's still a Latino, after all.Actually, this is a Hollywood ""message movie,"" and you know what that means. It's about as subtle as Michael Moore. Those who agree with the message flock to be beaten about the head by it for two hours. Those who the filmmakers would like to see the movie, those who don't agree with the message, stay as far away from it as possible.There's a scene in the library where nobody wants to sit at the table with AIDS boy. The way they stared at him reminded me of ""lao wei in China"" experiences. Denzel's character was reminded of segregation, even though he's too young to remember it, and started to care about Tom Hanks' character.AIDS discrimination is bad. Actually, any discrimination at all is bad. And that's the movie's message. I agree with the message, but still. That's all we've got.As a totally irrelevant non-sequiter, if the name ""Sam Francisco"" means anything to you, you've seen subtle commentary on discrimination.I love a great courtroom drama. This one was merely good. With so much of an agenda to squeeze into a two-hour film, they had to take a few shortcuts here. Sad, ain't it? But even so, a well-intentioned film that I'm glad I saw. Once. Not twice. Once is enough, thank you."	pos

12	If someones asks you what is a movie,or a film,I guess the right answer would be that it's a continuing view of images which appear incredibly fast,thus creating us the illusion of moving pictures.Films are supposed to entertain us,and sometimes even give us a message.''THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST'' does all that(entertaiment is not only having fun,but also getting in touch with your feelings)-but not only that.In this film we watch the last hours of Jesu's mortal life.This incudes aucorse a lot of blood and a lot of whips.Many people said that the film shows those scenes just to impress.Others say that they are over the edge-meaning Jesus wasn't beaten that much.And some others even think that there is no historical proof that Christ existed(you don't need proof to believe,but anyway).Now,I could spend two hours on my computer writing why they are wrong,but unfortuently this is a movie review so I am not allowed.All I can say to them is this:You are mistaken.For the ''over the edge scenes'',and ''Jesu's existense'' you will have to read some books,but for the ''violent scenes just to impress'' I can explain.The film is not about that.The film shows you the innoscense of Jesus,like a simple man,and like a Messiah.Then we are shown the people's reaction on His innoscense,His love to the same people that beat Him,while they beat Him.An alternate title for this movie could never be ''How to beat up Jesus'',but it sure could be ''What did our sins done to Him''.This film is not about violence,this movie is about love.I saw this film,and when it ended,I felt like I saw the most innoscent film on the planet.I suggest you watch this masterpiece.If you are good-hearted,open-minded,and read some books,this movie could change your life.	test
13	"What an achievement, for Mr. Smith to recruit a dozen or so top celebrities to recite bits and pieces of his personal religious beliefs to a captive audience.  Truly unbelievable.  My guess is that most religious and non-religious viewers will find something to their distaste in this film (the appearance of the ""fecal Golgothan"" was particularly unpleasant to sit through).  In addition to the unconvincing and gruesome special effects (Ben Affleck's head gets blown off!), Mr. Smith's eclectic philosophy is not terribly original, taking bits of Catholic mythology and peppering them with obscure Fundamentalist rants (i.e., the Virgin Mary has other children by Joseph, the ""morning star"" of Isaiah is a reference to Satan).  Meanwhile, the bloodier side of Christianity is laid bare as we hear that Damon and Affleck's characters have been on earth ""since the time of the plagues"", and watch these two angels ""smite"" a boardroom full of entertainment execs who operate a company named after the ""golden calf"".Go out and watch ""Clerks"" and forget about this nonsense from an amateur theologian.  Smith is a better authority on ""snowballing"" than on transubstantiation.  Stick with what you know...."	test

16	I am a lover of comedy and entertainment. This movie is NOT comedy. And I do not classify this movie as entertainment. This movie is one that shows (as close as one can on a movie set) what happens in REALITY. Each and every role could be an academy award nomination. A script which required a vast amount of knowledge of the subject. And the best hollywood effects (It was filmed in Munich, Germany at Bavarian Studios)which surprizes me. I have been through the original set which also amazed me because of the thoroughness and detail the sets displayed. Back to the issue. This sub commander could have been one of our own. His responsibilities an how he reacts to them makes us realize what goes on both sides of the fence. I was never in a sub, however I am now more aware and an feel for these men and women of today because of it. Good acting and actors, good plot, good effects.	test
17	Let me see if I have this straight. Enough people went to see Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery that it spawned a sequel? That means enough people thought it was funny? Frankly, I'm embarrassed to come from  the same country as Mike Myers. I'm also a little lost as to what genre  Myers is supposed to be parodying, certainly Sean Connery or Roger Moore  never ran around in blue velvet leisure suits, and at least came from the  right island to warrant an accent. Myers stumbles through this film like a  blindfolded man in search of his next one-liner or pratfall. What I really  loath him for is because her brought the word `shag' back into common usage  and `Yeah, baby!' became part of the cultural norm.Myers seems to  be turning into this generation's Woody Allen, for where else could someone  that repulsive, even without the fake bad teeth appliance and press on  chest hair that looked as though he skinned a wookie, get into position to  fondle so many woman. And in the second film he loses his `Mojo', a word I  used long before Myers was even Wayne on SNL, so now he's neurotic. All  they need now is for the third film to take place in New York and they've  got the Woody Allen schtick down pat. Additionally, given how often Austin  laughs at his own jokes, Myers also thinks he's funny. What he probably  does find amusing is how much money he's making.So what's the film  about? Who really cares, since it's mostly Myers mugging for the camera as  though he were some drunken college student who has just discovered that  one of his frat buddies has just pointed a video camera at him. In fact all  they did do is recycle a tired plot then attempted to make it funny.  Basically, (and I mean that in the most literal sense), Powers' nemesis, in  1967 Dr. Evil has himself frozen in suspended animation so that he can  awaken in 1997 where he can threaten the world without having Powers around  to thwart him. Little does he suspect that Powers has himself frozen so he  can be there when Dr. Evil gets out. Myers is actually Dr. Evil as well and  as such does make me laugh.We also get to see Myers pretend to be  the `stranger in a strange land' bit when he discovers that all of tired  old cliche lines that he used in the 60's are now surprisingly out of  place, improper and offensive. Yeah, like the world has just gotten so much  more civilized in 30 years. It became a tired race until the next time  Austin said something inappropriate so everyone could stop and stare.  Andrew Dice Clay gets the same reaction and he isn't funny either. Maybe my  tastes are too refined, but since almost anything by Zucker &amp; Abrams  makes me laugh, I somehow don't think so.	test
18	why the screenwriter decided to ditch all the most famous dialogue and many of the most pivotal scenes in this extremely pedestrian &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. All lost are the Aunt's deathbed confession to Jane, the buddha-like teachings of Helen in the hellish Lowood school, the gypsy fortune telling scene that infuriates Blanche Ingram, and even the chestnut tree cleft in half as a manifestation of God's displeasure! No sign either of &quot;He saw that the boy had inherited his own eyes as they once were: large, brilliant, and black&quot;--that's one of the most famous lines in English literature, for crying out loud!!I was more disappointed than I can say to see that Ciaran Hinds, so wonderful in &quot;Persuasion&quot;, was so terrible in this. And Samantha Morton as Jane was even worse. There wasn't a hint that she had lived through the childhood Jane Eyre had to become the governess Rochester encounters in the mist.Please, if you have never seen &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, don't make this sorry mess your introduction to that magnificient novel. Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine did such a better job of it!	test
19	"Compare this film to any other Woody Allen movie and you will see why it is the best and most solid work he ever did.His leading lady is also the sweetest, most beautiful, noble while still just a bit not-all-there ethereal beauty he ever starred with, and then she disappeared into the Sixties haze.THe gags are great, although through getting frequently stolen now fall flat in some cases. For instance when this was made having an escaping chain gang member respond to Woody's ""You're crazy!"" (of course later in his pretentious later movies he would have said You're insane) it was out of left field for the low life con to reply ""That's right! I'm a paranoid schizophrenic, but we're still going to escape!"" as the terminology was unknown to almost everyone back then. Also the reference to a high speed digital computer. Now it is not unusual for his aunt to have one, and the reference to What's my line? is lost now. Still this is the all time greatest Allen film, with the roots of later explorations.Never has he achieved this level of parody again, rather he now makes homages to other styles (as Curse of the Jade SCorpion mimics rather than mocks screwball comedies of sixty years ago.)Get it. It is the best we will see. Like listening to Bob Dylan while he was still awake and intelligent and not worn out by too much road and stuff."	test
20	"This has to be the most intelligently made film about Jesus Christ ever.  Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well.  Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material.  This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted.  Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind.  A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point.  To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free.  Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours.  The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery.  If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it!  Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears; all that's said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her.  Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala's flashbacks took away a bit of the film's impact for me.  Having readThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christwhich by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson's last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we'll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it's origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film.  In zealously trying to reclaim ""orthodoxy"" and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus.  A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul's journeys.  There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable.  Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library.  Required regular watching for all adult Christians and comes very highly recommended!Updated: 16 April 2012As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I've appended this update here: the Blu-Ray version of the Definitive Edition of this film is a vast improvement over the standard dvd and is now the optimal version of this film on disc.  The picture quality and especially the sound quality has been improved enough to warrant an upgrade from the standard dvd.  There are now two versions of the film with a slightly shorter and less violent version included as well as the full-length original.  The best film of Christ is now even better!"	test
21	"After about 1/4 or 1/3 of the way into this movie, one begins to wonder hard what the fuss was about.  The fact is, unlike Gibson's previous two major historical outings (Braveheart & The Patriot) this movie is about 80 % historical sources (in this case the broad outline of Matthew and other synoptics, with dialogue therefrom), 20 % the director.  The other 2 movies had a less than 50% historicism & were well over 50% personally interpretive -- and at very critical points.  In my view these last two directorial attempts by Gibson were flawed for such reasons -- given very questionable historical interpretations in both.  These were the trepidations I had before viewing this movie, rather than the rest of the unbelievable hoopla.The fact is, lacking either Roman or Jewish sources for Christ's passion (although both the Roman Tacitus and the Jewish Talmud admit Christ was actually put to death during Pilate's tenure) there is no detailed historical source other than the gospels for this story, like it or not.  Coldly viewed, the film is thus no different than several other films which more or less rigorously follow some pre-existing text -- putting aside the question whether the text is fact or fiction, ie. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon ( historical novel), Fellini's Satyricon (ancient book that may or may not be historically based), The Bounty (mixed fact and fiction). It is virtually impossible to imagine a filmic treatment of any text that does not have at least a 10 to 15% dose of interpretation from the maker. So the criticism that has followed  is necessarily not based on the Gibson interpretation, but against the gospel itself.  The argument, necessarily then, must be that the gospel should no longer be represented filmically, for some reason.  This is a political question, since such censorship could only be enforced by political means.  Despite many expressed fears, such a result -- outright censorship -- is hardly likely in the United States, now or in the forseeable future.In brief, if didacticism is properly understood as the artist's overlay of personal vision and interpretation -- and not what the artist's personal creed (religious or political) happens to be -- the film is much less didactic than Gibson's other ventures into historical presentation, and for that matter much less didactic than the vast majority of other film.  The current criticism, again, necessarily is with Gibson's own doctrine; rationally speaking it could not be with the fact he has one (since any honest person will admit that every adult has some sort of a belief system in the broad sense of the word).The historicism of Passion is visually obvious to any rational viewer, believer or unbeliever.  To a disinterested viewer, ie., one without any particular religious axe to grind, the movie resembles nothing so much as an attempt to portray the confusion and cruelty of the ancient world in a highly realistic and authentic manner.  Why this should not be a valid enterprise for an American realist would be hard for critics to say; they avoid the issue.  Research on the institution of Roman crucifixion and scourging demonstrates that this sort of scholarship much more informs the making of Passion than, say, Gibson's use of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, which while it has been much vaunted is really only window dressing here.  The long and short of it is that the scourging (the truly new element in this passion film presentation, never previously so fully rendered in other films about Christ) is highly informed realism consistent with scholarship and with the reason for this scourging, in Christ's case.  See  Zugibe, ""Forensic and Clinical Knowledge of the Practice of Crucifixion"" (Turin 2000); Zaninotto, ""The Shroud and Roman Crucifixion:  A Historical Overview"" (Turin 2000).The realism and subtlety of the portrayal of Roman leaders and the Roman system in this film far outdistances the best of similar recent ventures, ie. Gladiator.  It matches the highest standard I know of in this area, Kubrick's Spartacus.  I doubt Gibson's Pilate will ever be improved upon; it is worth the price of admission.  You may like this or that disciple in the film more, but take a close look at Pilate if you can stand it; this guy is really us.I would also frankly admit that the Jewish authority figures are not presented with the same subtlety.  It would be a better film if they had been.  But their milieu in this film is not presented as malicious in any sense, rather highly confused (which Pilate points out).  In any event the figure who is quite obviously the hero of the film, in the full classical sense, Jesus, not only reinforces Pilate's verdict on their behavior -- ""they know not what they do"" -- but also explicitly forgives them.  A person attempting to pin an anti-Semetic didacticism onto this film therefore ignores the most pointed statements on the subject by the story's focus and hero -- a most dubious venture.  Of course, it is well known that the anti-Passion  campaign has only been successful by innuendo, guilt by association (Gibson's father), and other tactics unworthy of serious discourse.If one is reduced to keeping count of such things as an indicator, the subtlety of the psychological realism of the characters portrayed, and their corresponding sympathy, switches polarity at the street level (unlike Caiphas, most ordinary Jews at street level are remarkably ""round,"" in E. M. Forster's sense, as compared to the rank and file Romans who, unlike Pilate, are somewhat cartoonish).  Such an effect is not possible, of course, if the director or text is anti-Semetic.  Before using such terms regarding film, one ought to know the real thing by having viewed a couple ""educational"" films from Nazi Germany about the science of eugenics.  In any event, true racism is objectively presented in the movie -- of certain Romans against Jews.Beyond the authentic/realistic context, our hypothetical viewer without a particular credal axe to grind, knowing nothing of the new testament (like a man from Mars) would most likely just legitimately wonder -- why are they doing this to this man?  The film's explanation (based on Matthew) is Jesus' apparent claim to be part of a deity, by a certain formula of words.  Focusing on the passion, the film does not fully explain this -- the man from Mars would basically come away with an impression of some sort of great taboo that was broken, causing frenzy and confusion among the Jewish authorities.  But again, malice would not be the conclusion.  Indeed Caiphas is portrayed as not wanting to kill Christ before the taboo words are spoken.  An objective atheist or our man from Mars could not then come away holding that any sort of assumed racial defect or malignancy was the cause.  If anything, it is the sheer power of the taboo that is the cause.  A true atheist or confident rationalist would not fear this critical focus of the movie, then, since he would reject the taboo ipso facto as a religious belief system.  Indeed he might well yet be interested in the film, very interested in it indeed, as a modern attempt to authentically portray the consequences of breaking a powerful taboo in the ancient world.The fact is, I have heard no criticism based on the fact that the movie justifies the breaking of the taboo against saying ""I am.""  Yet a truly principled attack on the movie would not only have to start there, but grapple with that centrally, and then say something in favor of continuing that taboo in conclusion, ie, censorship of texts or artworks that include that verbal formula.  Of course, none of us have heard such a thing.Regarding the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the Marian and/or ""stations of the cross"" images, etc.:  this is nothing more than Gibson's signature, the 20% quotient of interpretivism.  It is mainly visual, and neither adds nor subtracts any major element not in the source, Matthew.  It is a question of emphasis.  And it serves to give artistic unity to the whole.  Yes, it does also admit that Gibson is a believer -- such an unambiguous admission to the audience actually being an honest, and therefore praiseworthy virtue, even from the perspective of an ethical pagan.  Only certain modern pagans, cut loose from Aristotle, Homer, and the roots of Western culture, advocate the creation of subversive artwork that fools or tricks its audience into beliefs or attitudes cleverly disquised or contra-indicated.  While a prime tool of Marxists, such tactics were considered unworthy in the ancient world and indeed there are no known texts from that world which employ such a strategy.Actually, the real subject of this movie is conversion.  Gibson conveys Christ's gaze as the operative machine of this process, with some analogy  to the fine use of Christ's shadow by director Nicholas Ray in King of Kings (1961).  Comparing and contrasting to this and other filmic precedents would be more interesting than much of what we have been hearing, not only from foes but also from some purported friends of Passion.I have been trying to write this in a manner to avoid taking a lot away from a fresh first viewing, which I certainly urge.  But I cannot help adding one last comparison -- of the Simon scene to John Paul II's poem, ""Portait of a Cyrenean"" a/k/a ""Simon of Cyrene.""  One cannot claim that Gibson read the late pope's poem, but the visual parallels are remarkable.Actually, your best prep for this movie might be to rent out a good silent movie, like Abel Gance's Napoleon or anything featuring Chaplin.  The subject appears to have pushed Gibson back to the roots of cinema: gestures and faces.  Thankfully not everything is subtitled.My overall conclusion: 3.85 stars out of 5.  I don't hold with those that think this is the greatest movie ever made.  The Christian Word -- which includes the dogma of a personal Savior and all the eccentricity that may go with it --is  inherently incapable of a 5 star movie, or a 5 star artwork of any kind.  The closest post-Biblical Christian literature came to 5 stars was Dante, who admitted his failure in his Divine Comedy's last line, and that was a supreme admission from a very proud man and ought to set us all to fear and trembling.  Rembrandt for the most part gave us a lot of 3.75 star Jesus paintings, and to borrow from Hemingway, he probably had the best shot at the title.  Well, there is a fine Rembrandt etching of the Crucifixion that clocks in at about 4.1.  As for the movies, every sincere effort gives you a facet of the Christ -- Jeff Hunter in King of Kings, teamed up with Nicholas Ray behind camera, was heading for a 4.3 maybe, but as we say in Indy town, he ""kissed the wall.""  See it again anyway and ignore a lot of the script (based on the top ""scholarship"" of its day, by the way).Saint Bernard, a.d. 1200, saw the West taking a questionable turn before the Renaissance, as far as religious art is concerned:  a return to sheer classic realism is a gain, of course, but also a loss because the room for the personal vision is thereby limited.  If you have seen Michelangelo's Pieta you cannot imagine that scene ever another way.  I thus don't grant any Michelangelo, DaVinci, Raphael, Bernini etc more than a 3.7 when it comes to Jesus Christ.  Mel gains not because he's more talented than those guys, but because those guys are his school and he builds on them.  Many justifiably still prefer icons in this particular competition.John the Apostle even threw in the towel on this one, you know: ""He said many other things but not all the books in the world ...."" & etcetera.  So as our famous dean of American realism might have put it, ""Don't get into the ring with John the Apostle.""Of course, Mel did get into the ring, didn't he?  Of his hubris there is no doubt -- its just not very apparent in this movie, though, scene by scene -- or at least on the surface.  As for even undertaking the project -- sure, that's some hubris, all right.  But Gibson's stepping into this ring only proves that in the realm of art, certain rules can be broken if counter-balancing compensations are made.  Here, as in much of the best art of this country, the bow was to the aesthetic of realism with both feet.  The movie has much more in common with Clint Eastwood's unflinching look at the old west in The Unforgiven than with any filmed version of any didactic tract or religious text.  If you want your didacticism plain, go see a Star Trek movie and may be the wind be at your back.As for this film, there's enough going on in it -- including much not mentioned here -- that you should avoid as much of the debate as possible, even or especially from Mel's friends, and just go see it with an open mind as to what will hit you from a talented believer shrewdly aware of both his own limitations and those of film generally."	test

24	"I notice that Argento is most often praised for his ""set pieces,"" which are usually the suspense/murder sequences. I have to agree I enjoy these very much. He can be very slick. His movie ""Tenebre"" is actually fairly well constructed. It is about an American novelist Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) who came to Rome to promote his book only to be mired in the tragic deaths of many beautiful women. Seemingly based on his recent novel the girls (and others) all die horrific deaths with Argento's arsenal of ways to kill pretty Italian girls. Three very memorable scenes in this movie to my mind, and a recurring theme of deep human despair which I have found in his movies so far. Two scenes here which specifically communicate this sense of futility. The first of which involves eight or maybe nine if you go back all the way to the introduction of the minor character involved turns of fate in a lengthy and relentless sequence characteristic of Argento's films and for which I can see why he is sometimes compared to Hitchcock (though is it appropriate to do so???). It is a turning point in the film. I am reminded of the scene with the pile of razor wire in ""Suspiria"". The other scene in ""Tenebre"" more graphically identifies that theme in the image of a character impaled on a polished piece of metal, trying to pull it out but his hands are too slippery with blood to grip the object.Stylistically speaking the movie departs from garish and moody lighting of ""Suspiria"" for a more frontal, ""realistic"" look. If that hallucinogenic quality is the only thing a person liked about those movies. Interestingly enough, people complain that it looks like a TV show and the commentary notes that Argento was looking into the lighting of American television police drama to incorporate into this film. Don't mistake, color is still important. You will notice there is a lot of white so that when someone gets killed.... The other Argento trademarks are here, and effectively so. Camera movement, cutting, and soundtrack are still extremely important. The soundtrack is by three of the members of Goblin and, while of course sounding dated, fits very well, especially in one scene where you hear probably the whole main theme played over the duration of a long elaborate crane shot. I'm still amazed that in a movie where sound is so important I am able to forgive mediocre dubbing.If you ever find yourself trying to argue that Argento isn't a misogynistic film director, make sure you try and sway the conversation away from this film. The vast majority of sick violence is directed at the fairer sex, but never mind! The murders are typically well orchestrated, and it is obvious which part of his film that Argento values the most. I see that's part of reason why many respect this guy so much - he gives horror fans exactly what they want."	test
25	"One of my child hood favorite G-films released on a DVD of incredible quality. This DVD has even more special features than ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"", with an image gallery included. This time David Kalat was the `G-expert' selected for the commentary. I think he delivers an entertaining performance as he mainly focuses on the evolution of Godzilla from a serious villain to a campy and comical hero. He tells us his opinion on the matter and how it really affected the original series. The image gallery has some nice photos with captions and in the end another great classic media release."	test

28	First let me say I love Godzilla movies, but that does not mean I had to like them all. Godzilla vs Bipllant is so boring not even the good fx could save this movie. When I put in the movie I found myself staring at the walls and falling asleep. This movie got actors that nobody cares about and the story took forever to get to the point. The movie is all about g-cells then some dude daughter dies she then became a plant, I think? When it comes to Godzilla I have to say the 60's are the best, the other good G-film to own is Finale Wars!	test

30	Although criticised for its dubious inaccuracies, the movie is good to watch and is of the sixties epic style.Two great actors in Anthony Quinn and Oliver Reed are enough to put it into that category.	test
31	I did not find Crash shocking or challenging.  I did find it sad and depressing.  If that was Cronenberg's intent, he succeeded admirably.What I could not find in the movie was any human motivation anywhere in these characters.  Their joyless couplings become repetitive and are meant to express....what?  That they are so alienated and jaded that only by the severest forms of sensation (car crashes, injury, mutilation) can they become sexually arroused?  Well, that was conveyed in the first 30 minutes.  And then is repeated ad nauseum until the final scene, with neither growth or any further insight for the characters or the audience.We live in an age where people do disfigure themselves, often in some sort of sexual expression.  And that our car culture has sexual undertones is no new revelation (just look at the advertising). But this movie neither explains nor offers any insight into any of that.  It just observes their motiveless self-destructive behavior, turning the audience into voyeurs.I like many of Cronenberg's other efforts.  I admire the cast, though I would love to hear them explain what they think these people are doing and why.At some point observation of alienation and depravity crosses the line and becomes that alienation and depravity.  This comes uncomfortably close to that.  Maybe I'm just weary of this kind of new age existential despair.  If your worldview is this bleak, I pity you.At any rate, I give it 2 stars because it is well-made and a curiosity piece.  It obviously will stimulate some thought.  But, it is empty, cold and heartless at it's core and offers no great insight into the human condition.  Matter of fact, there isn't a recognizable human being anywhere in sight.	test
32	"No budget, little film stock, and only 3 (central) characters are the only things limited in this inventive indie-shot in Ft Wayne, Indiana no less.Last year's version, ""Swimming with Sharks"" showed that an  innovative idea, combined with some first rate acting can provide a  wonderful alternative to big budget, high efx fare.As with Sharks, the  subject matter here, that a venomous young man might engage a co-worker in  morally and emotionally degrading a young deaf woman, is extremely edgy  and, at many times, difficult to watch.I appreciate greatly the efforts  of all the principals, particularly writer-director Neil LaBute, and  actress Stacy Williams, who's performance as a hearing-impaired woman is  phenomenal.LaBute's follow-up (Your Friends and Neighbors) will be  highly anticipated, and likely put under a finer microscope, but enjoy In  the Company of Men for what it is, simple excellence."	test

35	This film, the sequel to GODZILLA VS. BIOLLANTE, is one of the very best of Toho's series. It begins with a very impressive musical score, and the arrival of people from the future. They say Godzilla will arise and lay  waste to Japan, and ultimately the world. So, they go back to remove the  Godzillasaur from Lagos Island(which is where he'll become Big-G)in place  of the dinosaur, three dorats are placed on the island. The creatures  become King Ghidorah. To defend Japan from Ghidorah's wrath, Godzilla is  reborn(100 meters!)The monsters fight, and at the end it is MechaKing  Ghidorah that delivers the final blow to Godzilla who is attacking Japan. A  very good movie! Highly reccommended for Ghidorah and Godzilla fans!	test
36	"I'm not a particularly religious person. I, fact, I tend to switch channels when the ""God slot"" comes on the TV. This, coupled with rumours of an anti-Semitic bias (certainly untrue IMHO) and no particular fondness for Mel Gibson (I regarded Braveheart and The Patriot as historically inaccurate anglophobic nonsense), put me off seeing this movie at the cinema.  My lady went to see it though and found it an immensely powerful experience and said I just /had/ to watch it.So I got the DVD, sat in my comfiest armchair surrounded by my 5.1 speakers, cup of tea at my side, and pressed play.Two hours later, the tea had gone cold and, with tears in my eyes, I felt utterly emotionally drained and profoundly moved in a way that no film has affected me before.  For that reason alone I could not award any less than five stars.Other reviewers here have already given detailed accounts of the screenplay and, as this is very much a movie that does /exactly/ what it says on the tin, I won't comment further on the story.  The consensus appears to be though that The Passion is very faithful to the Gospel accounts, although Gibson clearly does take some liberties with the personification of Satan (Rosalinda Celantano as a unsettlingly androgenous figure, which made me think of Marilyn Manson for some weird reason!).Magnificently filmed - from sweeping landscapes of a beautifully recreated holy land, to the excruciating detail of Christ's suffering, complemented by a powerful score and impeccable acting (most notably Hristo Shopov's oscar-worthy Pilate), this is a triumph, which you don't have to be a devout Christian to feel moved by.A unique cinematic experience, but one of such intensity that I don't know when I will watch The Passion again."	test
37	Oh my goodness, why did they have to make this [stuff] and then turn around and make another one.  I absolutely detest this movie!  First of all no Chris Tucker, second of all it was just a rehash of the same plot as the first one, and third of all it wasn't funny.No Chris Tucker is definetely a bad thing, but I understand that he didn't want to do it again.  Ice Cube could have gotten a replacement that was at least remotely close to being as funny as Chris.  But he settled for no talent Mike Epps, he's whiny, annoying, not funny at all, and has no chemistry with Ice Cube.  You could tell Craig was superior to Day Day, at least with Craig and Smokey they were pretty much equal, Smokey didn't let Craig run all over him.  Have you notice that Mike has only been in Ice Cube movies because nobody else wants him (and who would with talents like Chris Tucker, Martin, and Bernie Mac to name a few out there who are actually funny), okay yeah he had a small part in How High, like that movie is real credible.  Anyway it might have been better if Cube could have gotten somebody other than Mike Epps to be his sidekick.If I wanted to see the same storyline rehashed from the first, then I would just watch the first movie at least I can see Chris Tucker rather than Mike Epps.Like I before, this one was not funny, I think Kim Whitley and the mexicans got a light chuckle out of me, but other than that I didn't really laugh.  Word of advice, if you want to see a classic movie that makes you laugh throughout the whole movie, stick to Friday.	test
38	If you absolutely love the 1934 version starring Leslie Howard and Merle Oberon, or the 1982 version starring Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, you might absolutely hate this version. I say &quot;might&quot;, because your opinions of this version will definitely be colored by your attachment to the other versions and their leads.  I came to this video, having only seen the 1934 version a long time ago, and I watched all three versions within one week.First, the reviewers are right in identifying both the merits and faults of this version.  This is a way-out adaptation of the story, so much so, that you might not recognize the story as the original one written by Baroness Orczy. Having said this, I have to add that the way-out factor consists not so much of added scenes and characters (which the 1982 version has), but of the change in the character of the Pimpernel and the emphasis on him as a man-of-action, rather than a fop or a devoted husband.  There are also some major characters (in the series) bumped off either in the first episode or in subsequent episodes.If you are going to watch this, watch it as a historical romp updated for the 1990s and as a cross between the original Pimpernel and the action movies and commando movies so popular today.Also keep in mind that the romance factor (crucial in the book and in earlier versions) is reduced to practically zero, thanks to the screenplay and the palpable lack of chemistry between the leads (not to mention the miscasting of Marguerite). The most passion Sir Percy displays for his wife is when he is trying to outrun the mob to get to her.  [The prison scene, starting with him descending the steps down to this frantic race is one of my favorite clips in this movie].As for Marguerite, she displays more feeling for her brother than for her husband or her former lover.  Which former lover? Ah, you have to watch the movie to find that out, as well as the peculiar interpretation of her past in this version.Watch for Ronan Vibert's Robespierre and for Grant's varied smiles which convey different meanings.  His best film is said to be WITHNAIL AND I, which I will certainly look out for.Yes, this version has a lot of things wrong with French history - but so does the 1982 version.  This is *not* the film to watch to find out more about the revolution, even though it may be a cult favorite in AP History classes.  My problems are not so much with the history as introduced in this version (the film after all is about a fictional character, to begin with), or with the departures from the story - but with the lack of romantic passion (crucial in the original story), and the many unexplained puzzles (such as a) why would Sir Percy trust an actress of dubious morals, b) why would no Parisian notice men walking around in masks, and c) who informed on a French sympathizer who was guillotined).Great photography and music, interesting take on the story, pity about the lack of chemistry between Grant and McGovern and the many implausibilities in this version.	test
39	Just wanted to tell everyone that if they think the (WS) in the title means that this is Widescreen, they'll be upset.Anchor Bay DID release this on DVD before Disney did (as well as Condorman, North Ave. Irregulars, and Candleshoe), but Anchor Bay's release was full screen, and so is Disney's.As of this date (8/6/2010), there never has been a widescreen version of this released in any form, in any country. So don't get your hopes up.I think it's a pretty darn funny movie, by the way.	test
40	"I FEEL COMPELLED TO EDIT MY REVIEW.  I have watched the entire DVD set.  It has been a wonderful joy watching this show.  It is one of the greatest television dramas of all time, and easily the best ever within its genre.  But the quality of the DVD transfer here is, while often ""passable"" as I originally stated, is at other times downright awful!  The sound is bad.  The picture quality is often worse!  Such a legendary show deserves the best technology and care when being made into a DVD box set, and I do hope that the owners of this material one day invest the money and effort to do it.  I'd be first in line to buy such a product.  But again, its such a great show that even watching a poor transfer brings great joy.And now, here is my original review....I recall my parents watching this wonderful program when I was a child.  Last autumn it was announced that all new episodes were being made and that Jean March would be reprising her role as Rose.  I thought I would buy and watch all the episodes in advance of the 2011 release of the new series.First, let me say a word about some of the low reviews here, which give this DVD set only one or two stars.  All of them say the same thing.  They praise the series but are greatly disappointed at the video transfer quality.  I will ignore the transfer quality issues in this review.  It probably could have been better, and I hope one day a more definitive version is released.  But most of the time its not bad, and in fact more than passable.  If there were a separate rating system for the technical qualities of old TV shows being transferred to DVD, then that's where this DVD set would probably not score high.Well, having made those initial disclaimers, I guess I don't actually have a lot to say, other than this show's writing is brilliant, its acting is superb, and it captures the early 20th century so perfectly.  Its a series full of warmth, hilarity, intrigue, and suspense.  I have just finished watching the 16th episode with my wife and each episode seems even better than the previous one."	test
41	"The twenty minute whipping scene grossed me out. Stop; rewind; return to the video store. I prefer to remember Jesus by the way he LIVED, rather than the manner in which he DIED. It is not just a little morbid that people dwell upon the crucifixion - a Pagan punishment.When I was going to Sunday school, they taught us about the good deeds Christ performed, and didn't focus on the whipping, blood, guts, nails etc. But nowadays ""religiosity"" passes for true compassion and people shout about their religion like a tribal identity - and hate all the other tribes. It's about belonging ""to"" a big organization, rather than a personal philosophy. People want to be a part of something bigger than themselves.This movie will appeal to those with a sado-masochistic sexuality."	test
42	This is one of the most average horror movies I've ever seen. The 1990s was a miserable time for the horror genre. The fact that some consider Candyman to be an underrated classic highlights my point. I do like the idea of a researcher looking into an urban legend but the movie is just not well done. The characters are awful and the movie is simple not scary in any way.	test
43	This film holds a special place for me, because it was the only film I've ever seen at its world premiere, in LA in '77. My only free film junket, too, back when I edited a weekly newspaper in Minneapolis. I still remember the party with Spielberg and Melinda Dillon and Terri Garr & the little boy. Anyway, a classic of sci fi. I think it shows its age, but it's still lotsa fun. One caveat, though. This DVD edition is dull and murky looking; doesn't do the film justice. I would get the Blu Ray instead. Gotta be better.	test
44	sorry, but the feeling of immediacy of the original TV sketches really is the key for me when it comes to this material - hearing the audience reaction (not canned laughter, thank God!) is an important part of the  performance for me. I'll be the first to admit that, had I never seen the  TV show, I'd probably be just fine with the  film versions of these skits.  For a Python &quot;dabbler&quot; (i.e. greatest-hits-buyers) this disc is  just fine - but I'm going to invest in the entire collection of TV  originals instead . . .	test
45	"There are three kinds of bad comedy: The painful, the so-bad-its good and the boring. This movie falls in the third category. In 1998, a black movie bombed so bad in theaters that it was dissed by everybody. That movie was Woo. Steve Harvey even took a swipe at the movie in the Steve Harvey Show: ""Im available like 20 copies of Woo at Blockbuster"". Now I know that a movie that bombs at the box office doesnt always mean its bad but Woo really does stink. The positive reviews on Amazon are the first positive comments that I ever heard for this movie. I hated this movie. Everybody I knew hated this movie. These positive reviews are funnier than the actual movie itself. Woo looks like a sitcom that was canceled for a good reason.Story: Tim is set on a blind date with a Woo, a nutty woman who spends most of their date trying to loosen him up. They get into some messed up situations and end up falling for each other in the end.What kills Woo is that nobody in this movie is likable. Tim is a hapless geek, Woo is a neurotic freak and Tim's friends are the most ignoble and annoying black men ever in a movie. On top of all that Woo is quite boring. I watched it recently and had to fight sleep for 90 minutes. Its a shame to because the actors in this movie all have personality but it doesnt show in this film. Its not their fault, its the dull material they had to work with. There is only one time I laughed: when Frankie and Romaine where trying to convince Hop that he was being fawned over by drag queens. Every other attempt at humor falls flatter than Suge Knight after one punch. You know a movie sucks when Dave Chapelle isnt even funny in it and he can be very funny even when he is in a crap movie(think Screwed). In short dont waste your time with this bomb. The script sucks and every actor and actress looks like they were bored to death while participating in it. Plus Jada and Tommy have zero chemistry together. Jada Pinkett would move on into better things and Tommy Davidson's career started to fold after this movie. If you want a better movie starring Tommy Davidson stick with Strictly Business and Booty Call. If you want a better movie starring Jada Pinkett stick with A Low Down Dirty Shame. Woo is a waste of time and film."	test
46	The Lady Vanishes by Alfred Hitchcock is about an hour and a half. I have all but 2 or 3 of Hitch's films. This is one of the first I bought on AMZ because it was presumably remastered by Criterion on a blu-ray. But I soon found that it was remastered in the original 4:3 aspect ratio, not the full screen 1.77 listed in your Product Details, which should be changed. I have two more Criterion blu-rays that are also 4:3 (The 39 Steps and The Man Who Knew Too Much). This is perfect if your TV was purchased in 1938 when this film was released. I was born after that year, so I have no idea if TVs even existed that long ago. I am sure that blu-rays did not exist in 1938. I love blu-rays, but If all my blu-rays looked like this one, I would throw them all away.I like Hitchcock films or I wouldn't have bought so many of them, but this one didn't impress me.There are some positive reviews here. Read them and write a positive review if you like the film. I have written many enthusiastic reviews for Hitchcock films. I'm sorry, but I didn't even notice that Miss Froy was missing, whoever she was.	test
47	This stop animation special ultimately is a compelling allegory about the need to deinstutionalize children with disabilities, for the benefit of them--and society.A reindeer named Rudolph has a physical difference from his peers. Barred from attending reindeer school because of this difference, he ultimately discovers an island where 'misfit toys' with various deformities (a choo-choo with square wheels..etc) have been involuntarily isolated.Technically they are among their own kind so they should be happy, but they are instead gloomy. Unable to fulfil the role of what a toy SHOULD be doing, they instead feel lonely and punnished--wanting to escape the island and travel with Santa. They know that if they were like 'normal' toys, children would play with them.Joined by an elf-dentist named Hermey and a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (who does not add much to the story), Rudolph himself saves the day. And he maintains the love of a doe named Clarice who had always loved him for who he was, even when his own family was publically ashamed of his difference.Finally, it's important to note that Fireball and the other reindeer who teased him as 'children' could not even make Santa's prestigious team. In the end, Rudolph himself enables Santa to continue bringing toys to children around the world.	test
48	NIL BY MOUTH is a film that focusses on domestic violence, alcoholism and day-to-day life in a working class area of London.Actor Gary Oldman directed this film and it is very raw in parts, and hard to watch.The main problem with the film is that it takes too long for anything to really happen.  In addition, too much time is devoted to the character of Bill (who is quite an uninteresting character).The film really only pulls you in when the big guy starts beating up his wife.  This is of course extremely sad to watch but lifts you from the dullness of the film.  I was just about to nod off when this scene happened.Overall the film fails, because it relies on violence to make it the slightest bit interesting.	test
49	JawbreakerDarren Stein, DirectorDarren Stein, WriterRose McGowanJulie FreemanMarcie FoxLiz PunJudy GreerSorry, I didn't like this one.  This movie has tone problems and the underlying themes have jumped the rail and are all over the infield. This is a dark comedy about a cliquish group of four high school girls who think they control their school.  They say dark comedy is hard to do because the director is trying to make humor out of something that is not usually funny.  Well this movie goes the hard way.  A pretty young girl bound and gagged, who suffocates on a jawbreaker crammed down her throat while her mouth is sealed by duct tape.  I don't see the dark humor.  If she'd lived and gone on to some dark practical jokes that could have been material for dark humor.  I have seen death kidded in many movies, but some character development showing the light side might precede.  You know, some comedy to set the mood for laughing before the dark bomb.  The victim is just a pretty young girl who has done nothing we know of.  Even the actresses don't seem to know how to act in this movie so they act half cheerful and half grief stricken at the same time.  Rose McGowan(Courtney)is an controlling leader who tries to run things.  Rose tries to hold up the sinking film with assertiveness, dominance and clothes that complement her figure, but even Rose spends half the film scowling without a trace of humor.  Excuse me, dark humor. Rose's character Courtney is guilty of manslaughter and it bleeds tragedy into every thing she does.  Courtney is a nice looking little meany, but here she is tainted through and through.  There just isn't an outline for funny: anywhere! To ease up a bit, it's just a dark comedy that misses a fast ball.  It just needs an overhaul, lube job, and dark comedian. GJ	test
50	Paul Thomas Anderson doesn't seem capable of exhibiting any hint of subtle filmmaking.  Whether he has someone paint their brains on a wall or have a  middle-aged couple engaged in doggystyle coitus, he reeks of shock from top  to bottom.Not only on the surface, but his writing riddled with  profanity-per-second and over-the-top performances call more attention to  the fact that the viewer is watching a &quot;movie&quot;.  Julianne Moore's  performance in Magnolia almost made me forget how great she was in  &quot;End of the Affair&quot;.  Gone were any signs of a subtle and  meticulously constructed character.  She has never sounded more out of her  element, not even in &quot;Assassins&quot; did she seem to stretch so much.The opening camerawork would have made Mr. Handheld himself, Lars Von  Trier, nauseaus.  Covering sets like a hyperactive kid without ritalin does  not say one iota more about the story...after 20 minutes, the camera  finally settles down long enough to give you a chance to watch the actors'  performances.One amazing thing about this film is how the score enters  and simply does not know when to stop...if Paul Thomas Anderson had any  clue how to map out the beats in a story to music, he would have been able  to cut down the running time and tell the same story.  Instead, 30 minute  compositions, if you can call these hard dramatic eight measure loops that,  seem like an eternity of meandering dialogue.Meandering, is indeed,  the word that sticks to this film.  In giving the film two stars instead of  one, I found a couple storylines interesting.  TJ Mackey (Cruise) shows the  film's only semblance of a character arc.  The interview and gradual  breakdown Cruise shows is believable.  And John C. Reilly's police  character shows exactly how perceptually limited a cop is by his &quot;just  say no&quot; mentality...assuming a black woman is guilty, and a white  woman who snorts coke in the next room over can be dated.  His  single-minded character could have come straight out of a Coen Bros. or  Lynch film.If I want to see long-winded self-important monologues and  camerawork that aspires to Kubrick and Scorsese, I will watch the real  archetypes at work in the future.	test

54	THE PILLOW BOOK goes where few films have dared. Peter Greenaway is a unique artist and has created a touching story in a cinematic technique that is clearly his own.  Simply stated, The Pillow Book is a journal kept by Japanese women who write private thoughts about desire, beauty, sensuality, and the moments in life that are indescribably unforgetable.  In this story we see the unfolding of the life of a daughter of a calligrapher/writer who is able to provide for this beloved family and all their traditions by his assignations with his publisher.  The child is taught her father's skills, each birthday having her father write the story of creation on her face, signed by 'god' on her back.  This 'writing on the body' is eventually the means of gaining revenge on her father's demeaning publisher: she searches for the perfect lover (one who can make love as well as write beautifully in calligraphy) only to find a British translator (who happens to be the lover of her publisher)who encourages the girl to write her uniquely original books on his body - the matrix for delivery of her book to the publisher, a man who otherwise has rejected her gifts.  To reveal the ending would spoil the mesmerizing intrigue of the film.  Suffice it to say that love and honor eventually triumph...The techniques of cinematic magic include the simultneous use of Black and White photogrpahy with Color photography, screens within screens, still life within motion, the wonder of observing Japanese writing, the use of written scrolls superimposed on moments of story telling.  Greenaway is one of the very few directors who is unafraid of frontal nudity.  He has the beauty of Vivian Wu and Ewan McGregor which he paints sensually, allowing the camera to view the entire body being adorned both with calligraphy and with love making.  But seeing is believing and for those who thirst for originality in art, for adoration of the human form, for sensitive story telling with a subject that is wholly unique, then this film is a MUST.THE PILLOW BOOK should be in the art library of all art lovers.	test

58	"What is there to say about this movie? This is the story that portraying to us that God has opened the door for all to heaven. You can't sugarcoat what happened to Jesus, and you can't dumb it down. Listen up people, watch this movie and remember this as you watch it: This is all for you! No, not for all of mankind, but for you. God's love is so great for us that he would give his son for just one of us. This movie was made with a purpose, and it's purpose was fulfilled. Gibson did a masterful job as well as Caviezel.Listen to me, watch this movie...and if by the end there is not a tear running down your cheek then check your heart. No, don't check your heart, check if you have one. And if your heart doesn't jump and your whole world isn't upside down at the part where Jesus turns to say ""This day you will be with me in paradise"" to the sinner on the cross next to him, check your pulse. I have no idea where people are even coming up with these wild allegations that this movie is not in line with the bible, are you sure you watched the right movie and you aren't reading the book ""Adventures of Huck Finn""? I think that is just crazy because I've been studying the New Testament and I just don't see where it isn't following the Bible.This movie isn't fiction, it is real. THIS HAPPENED OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU! It was all for you. I watch that movie and just rejoice at the thought of someday I will be with that man in heaven. I can't wait until God comes for his loved ones. This movie is life-changing, no, this movie is the story of our lives and the greatest gift that has ever been given. I commend Mel Gibson in his passion on making the movie, the man has some gumption. Watch this movie, if you've seen it, watch it again and check your heart. Thank you for your time.And one of the soldiers looked at the cross and said ""Truly this man was the son of God!""Three days later...."	test

61	I had pretty high expectations for The Night Porter. The reviews are good and the premise seemed interesting. I often enjoy daring and provocative films, so I gave it a shot. Once it started, I kept waiting for it to develop and it never did. I kept saying to myself, `Finally, now we're getting somewhere...oh wait, never mind.' It just dragged on with little or no purpose. And I felt like it was edited by an 8th grade audio-visual club. The dubbing was bad, the writing/acting was labored and the direction was uninspired. What few points the film does score are earned by its relatively creative and esoteric premise. And since there weren't any other entrants in the 1974 `Post-War Era Sadomasochistic Nazi Film Festival', The Night Porter won first prize. But I think the main reason that this film has its cult status, or any following whatsoever, is good advertising. The DVD cover is intriguing, and honestly the cover is better than the film itself. Save yourself the time and money and rent it, or try another film. Schindler's List has some similar themes, mainly with Ralph Fiennes' character, although it is a far superior film of a different overall genre. As a last resort, I guess you could watch Triumph of the Will while sitting on a tack and achieve a comparable level of sadomasochistic Nazism. To each his own.	test
62	People tell me I am the spitting image of a young Robert Redford so I usually go out of my way for his movies. This one didn't have much substance, though. It's about a baseball player in the 1800's that is shot in the chest by a stray bullet and continues to play in a baseball game. Due to an electrical failure and a defective baseball, the game is halted and his team is granted the win to much fanfare. There is also a subplot with some woman... possibly a lukewarm love affair. I did not pay much mind to those parts so I can't recall every detail of it.	test
63	"The horror in horror movies generally comes from the threat of violence or death, and not from the deaths themselves.  It's not nearly as scary to watch someone get slaughtered as it is to watch them walk through a dark alley or meat packing plant, knowing that any minute they MIGHT be slaughtered.  Tension is where all true fear lies, especially in a world so jaded that even the image of a young man being patiently and methodically torn open can elicit yawns (or, at best, cringes).The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is robbed of much of its tension primarily because it is a prequel.  Therefore, it's not a spoiler to point out that none of the film's murdering psychopaths will be caught or killed (otherwise, the movies later in the timeline wouldn't make much sense).  Anyone who figures this out can use similar logical connections to pretty much guess how the whole thing will turn out.I'll give you some help.  It's 1969, a small town in Texas has just folded because its slaughterhouse has closed down, and the Hewitt family (featuring placid Uncle Monty, clueless Luda Mae, the lumbering mental defective Thomas, and grizzled patriarch Charlie) refuses to evacuate the premises.  Along come brothers Dean and Eric and their sweetly accomodating girlfriends, Chrissie and Bailey.  All four are ludicrously attractive, have legitimate (if not marginally boring) personalities, and are on the road for one last hurrah before the brothers are shipped off to join the Vietnam War (a splinter of a sub-plot that is meant to shoulder roughly 95% of the film's emotional merit).Guess what happens?  That's right!  People die!  Charlie Hewitt (played by a hammy R. Lee Ermey) takes charge of his family's survival.  Since their only means of support was the now defunct meat-packing plant, he decides that they will now have to live on a steady diet of bikers and hippies.  Those are his words, not mine.  Thus begins the Hewitt family's reign of terror (based on a true story, the movie tells us, via a way-too-ponderous narrator).Movies like these, where the ending is pre-ordained and the premise lacks corners for surprises to hide in, well, they have to rely on stylism to make up for a lack of a story, they must use skillful aplomb to take the place of a plot.  I won't deny that the filming is measured to a gritty perfection and that the cinematography adds the right kind of sandy smear to the scenes.  Also, the movie is not just graphic, but blissfully and consummately so.  I have a hard time remembering ever before having seen such graphic gore, such explicitly rendered violence.  Maybe I just don't get out much.However, as movies like ""Lost In Space"" or ""Starship Troopers"" can teach us, a preponderance of special effects (even those executed perfectly) does not a good movie make.  I have no doubt that some people will eat this film up (so to speak); you will too, if all you really want to see are the vivid murders of mostly innocent people.  This is obviously one of the movie makers' primary goals, and in that sense the flick is a triumph.  However, as a horror film, its central purpose should be to frighten, to keep the audience on edge, to amp the tension and keep it on the edge of the breaking point.  ""TCM: The Beginning"" has no tension, no edge, no breaking point, no fear.  It has psychopaths who (for the purposes of the story) cannot be caught or killed, it has huge vats of blood and exposed tendons and veins, it has torture, dozens of mutilating weapons, and a guy who is known affectionately as ""Leatherface.""For some, I guess that may be just enough."	test
64	Other reviewers have pointed out just how bad this movie is. It is SO cheesy, it nearly made me physically ill.

65	If I could rate this zero stars I would. A totally perverted view of the Story of Christ. A base film that totally panders to a bloodthirsty audience with short attention spans.  It's no wonder it was a hit. It offers nothing of the teachings of Christ to a novice. If you want to see a moving well made version of this story, seek out Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew. Gibson is laughing all the way to the bank!	test
66	"I bought this movie because of my girlfriend's recommendation.  I told her that I loved the movie ""The Money Pit"" with Tom Hanks and she said I just had to get ""Mr. Blandings Dream House"".  In all fairness, I did not finish seeing the movie to the end but came within a half hour of seeing the entire movie.  Why?  Because it was that bad...not even a chuckle.  Even if the last half hour was rip roaring hilarious which I highly doubt, it would not be worth seeing.  I love Cary Grant but this movie did not do him justice.  The quality of the movie was excellent but who cares if the movie stinks.  I don't know why other reviewers are giving it such high marks.  I may be missing something but I'm not going to waste another 2 hours to find out what it was. Stick with ""The Money Pit"".  It's the REAL ""Dream House""."	test

68	"After seeing A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's  Revenge you as the audience will have to ask yourself ""Are scriptwriters supposed to see the movie they're writing a sequel for, or just guess what the story is?""  That's exactly what Nightmare 2 comes across as, because no one seems to have a clue as to what type of movie they're supposed to be making.So the story is that Freddy Krueger wants to possess some boy whose moved into the house formerly inhabited by Nancy from the first film in order to start killing people again...why?  Doesn't Freddy Krueger kill teenagers in their dreams?  Apparently he got his dream haunting license revoked by Satan between this sequel and the original due to his embarrassment at the hand of one teenage girl with a booby trap book, because he doesn't kill anyone in their dreams throughout this entire film.  Nope, instead he has to try and possess some dude in order to...get in the real world?  Really?  I though Freddy was WEAKEST when in the real world.  Doesn't everything in Craven's original film kind of show him as a pushover when he was brought into Nancy's real house?  So why Freddy wants to get in the real world where he's vulnerable to REAL pain is beyond me.Then we have our actors.  A fresh, new teenage cast who befalls one of the world's most feared forces: a crippling lack of talent!  No one in this movie could act, and spend most of the time seeming to struggle to remember lines or motions which leads to some of the most unintentionally funny bits I've ever seen in a film not featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000...in fact thinking back at it, in this film you'll see more laughable, unintentional homoerotica than all of Joel Schmaucher's Batman & Robin!Then there's the script writing such as a bird randomly exploding after apparently getting bird rabies from Freddy.  The father's response to a - an obviously paper - bird exploding is accusing his son of shoving a cherry bomb into it...HOW?  This is simply the one quote I remember, but trust me, the entire script is full of these moments.  Only person who gets out of here with any dignity is Robert Englund, who luckily just has a few lines, most of which are short monologues or one-liners (which I sure hope were intentionally written to evoke laughs from Englund's deep Freddy voice cursing).Unless you're a fan of MST3K style riffing of bad movies (which, luckily, I am and thus made it through this movie A-OK) than you will want to avoid this movie at all costs.  This movie, for those joking crowds, definitely falls under the ""So-Bad-It's-Good"" genre, but that doesn't change the fact that if you aren't into that you will hate, hate, HATE this movie with a passion.If you're a fan of Wes Craven's character then you will want to avoid most of the Nightmare sequels (#3 is worth giving a try though), but if you're not a fan of unintentionally funny movies and would prefer to see Freddy as Wes Craven conceived him I suggest sticking to the original film and Wes Craven's New Nightmare."	test

71	"I'll mention this straightaway: if you're a Satriani fan, you might be disappointed. I am, and I was. Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a ""power trio"" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, ""Summer Song"" sounds terribly thin with the guitar ""way up here"" and the bass ""way down there."" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's ""Live in San Francisco"" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. ""The Attutute Song"" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks. Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality."	test

76	I have been a Mel Brooks fan for years.  I received the Blu-Ray edition of this Collection as a Chanuka Gift & I can Honestly say that this is one of THE best gifts I have EVER received.  Mel Brooks is one of the best Comedic Directers EVER!  And This encompeses his best work.  9 Movies from the 1970's through the 1990's.I Particularly Love Young Frankenstein & History of the World Part 1.

Or the Hilarious send up of history/biblical tales that Brooks provides (I bring you these 15....Crash!  OY! These 10, yes 10 Commandments!)?  Or poking fun of racism & social mores (Blazing Saddles) that Brooks provides?  Let's face it, regardless of which Brooks' movies you prefer....You will NEVER get a bad one & ALWAYS laugh with any of his movies.

78	"I dunno...I watched this movie expecting it to, at least, arouse SOME sort of emotion, but really, my strongest reaction ended up being, okay...that was pretty boring.  The problem is, it's just dramatically inert.  There's no sort of progression or anything; just wham wham wham the power of christ compels you the end--and the violence is so stylized that even the most basic of visceral reactions is precluded.  Further, Jesus in this movie is so obviously an allegory rather than an actual person that it's impossible to feel anything for him.  They might as well be beating on a pinata.  There's a VERY short snippet from the Sermon on the Mount, and a few other flashbacks, but really, who's fooling whom?  These have about the same weight as story segments in a porn film (which this in many ways IS); they're a tedious obligation, and underplayed as much as possible...which may well be a blessing in disguise; while Caviezel is adequate as a meat puppet, he's not so much so when required to actually, you know, act.  The only at all sympathetic, interesting, or indeed human character in the film is Pilate (though the scene with the camp King Herod is one of the movie's few truly amusing moments); however, as far as that goes, you'd probably be better off just reading The Master and Margarita.In many ways, the film's anti-semitism is the least of its problems; however, it is there for anyone who cares to see it.  Physically, the hook-nosed, beady-eyed, conniving Jewish patriarchs embody every Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion-style stereotype in the book (whereas Jesus and the posse are clearly already Christians, in spite of actually being, you know, Jewish themselves), and while the Roman soldiers may be comically sadistic, the Patriarchs are obviously the primary villains here; the solidiers are just their blunt instruments.  It's not necessarily something that's going to leap out at you unless you're really looking to have your prejudices reinforced, but I can see it being pretty unhealthy for anyone on a subliminal level.Granite, there is a fair level of artistry here, even if most of it's wasted.  The opening is atmospheric (though that mood is quickly destroyed when the disciples start busting out the mad ninja skillz on the Roman soldiers), and the creepy androgynous Satan is reasonably cool.  Also...okay, actually, that's about all.  I didn't find the film particularly painful to sit through, but I don't really recommend it either, except in a ""see what everybody's talking about"" way.  But if you do see it, you have to follow it up with South Park's ""Passion of the Jew.""  Hysterical stuff."	test

83	If you're looking for typical teen slasher fare, then this is *not* the film for you, but if you're looking for a truly adult serial killer terror  film, Tenebre is a masterpiece.  Argento's virtuso filmmaking technique is  used to great effect in this film, creating genuinely sinister and  suspenseful atmosphere, with amazing, sometimes jaw-dropping camerawork,  brutal but elegantly staged murders, and all in the service of a very  clever and well-plotted mystery from Argento that kept me guessing right up  until the end.The music score by members of long-time Argento  collaborators The Goblins is used very effectively, and Anthony Francisosa  gives a fine performance in the lead, as an American writer in Rome, who  becomes personally involved when the murders in his lastest novel start  coming true.Anchor Bay has done a superb job with this release; if you  are still buying VHS like me, this is about as good as it gets.  The  picture and sound quality are excellent, the VHS is letterboxed in the  film's proper 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and is presented unrated and uncut, as  all Argento films should be.	test

85	&quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra 2&quot; is really a girl's answer to a Godzilla movie. It stars many girl in the cast, the story line is really feminine, and Mothra is a girl, so there you are. Probobly my least favorite of the  new series of movies. Hats off to Battra though, he's awsome... he's like  Megalon and Mothra combined! Mothra is really un-realistic in this film. In  the original &quot;Godzilla vs. Mothra&quot; (1964), Mothra was pretty, but  her head and body were a more realistic yelloish color, in here shes bright  white, and you can tell her eyes have lights in them. Godzilla dosen't  appear much in the movie either, which is wrong. Like alot of people, I'm  very dissapointed that all these new Godzilla movies are in the awful SLP  quality! The picture is blurry, the sound is muffled and just looks bad.  Tri Star should be ashamed of themself, first releasing that new Godzilla  movie and now releasing the better films in SLP mode! So, all in all... If  you like Mothra, you will like this film. If you hate Mothra, you will hate  it, and if you love both Godzilla and Mothra, it's okay. Nuff' said.	test

88	I have a very close relationship to Jesus and the faith I have in him is very strong. I've struggled throughout my life physically going in and out of hospitals with surgeries and procedures. Through this, I've always felt that Christ was always near me in my most trying times as a young child to my adult years. He's never given up on me and I'll never give up on him.When I first heard of the movie, I was curious to see how Mel Gibson would portray it. When it was finally released, part of me wanted to see it while the other part didn't. In a way, I felt I had to because in a way, I was there with him through *his* most trying times in his life. He was there for me when I was struggling, and by me watching him I was there for him. I was glad I saw it, but I will most likely never see it again. Once is enough for me. :)I really do recommend people see this. Not only as a religious point of view, but as a learning experience for all.	test
89	I found this movie to be quite overrated.  This was yet another movie billed as a comedy but that produced very few laughs.  The thin plot grew tiresome quickly.  The best part of the movie is the sing-along and the music.  It's not that it's a &quot;bad&quot; movie, it's just not immensely entertaining.  I'd buy the soundtrack before I bought the movie.  It's odd because Julia Roberts typically makes much better choices.  Go with Mystic Pizza, Runaway Bride, or Notting Hill instead.	test

The 4 parts of this epic are spectacularly produced, marvelously written, finely acted, and are interesting, entertaining, engrossing and instructional all  at once.The detail of these productions is superb, as is the sense of  place and time.

Having it in my collection now will rekindle all of those happy thougths and make the Christmas season all the brighter as I will not have to wait for it to show up on my television.The story is a simple, sweet tale of frienship, trust, and overcoming problems.  It shows how to have confidence in yourself and be able to help others in the same situation.  Everyone has a place in society regardless of how they look (Rudoplh, misfit toys) or what they do (Herbie, the elf who wants to be a dentist).The animation is amazing when you realize that this is not computer generated.  It had to be done by hand, frame by frame.  That alone makes this a classic in the art of entertainment.	test
92	"If you already have (and love) the Alistair Sim version (Scrooge, 1951), the Reginald Owen version (1938) and Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (no, I'm not kidding, it's beautifully done), this will be an interesting film for comparison.Two good points stand out for this version of Dicken's classic Christmas story:1) Since it is an adaptation, set in a different time and place from the original (Depression-era New England), deviations from the text and basic plot-line, are not as bothersome as they are in the films that adapt the story in ""Dickensian"" England.2) Henry Winkler, who, at the time, was playing against his well-known Fonz character, gives an excellent characterization to the Scrooge-like Benedict Slade.George C. Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying."	test
93	"Almost everything is enlightening, especially on repeated viewings, in Steven Spielberg's best movie (IMHO).  And there seems not a wasted frame (even in cut/uncut/recut DVD extras) involved in this, a strange, wonderful SCI-FI/FANTASY film that blurs the lines joyfully between the two genres.On one hand, CE3K is based upon just enough facts and evidence (with credibility) about the UFO/ET phenomenom (continuing to present day) to effectively suspend disbelief in the audience, but is filled with amazing and eye candy CGI special effects to realize that vision of those crazies who have been contacted.  And those who have yet not.  Except for the original Apocalypse Now (not the crappy and detracting ""redux""), this is almost a ""perfect film"" in every way.  Especially for ""Hollyweird.""  Shame this had to come in the same year as the original ""Star Wars.""  As well as other great films.Roy Neary is the everyman.  Just an ordinary American schlmoe in a small town, an electric power county repairman, who one unexpected night, called out on an emergency power blackout, is encountered on a dark, quiet, star-filled night sky, by something very strange, and beings far beyond his understanding.His truck is ""explored"" by a brightly lit UFO, turning his vehicle suddenly anti-gravity, and sunburning one side of his face as he tried to look up at the ET craft, in a truck whose electronic systems and radio have all gone haywire and dark.Everyman Neary (Richard Dryefuss) sees a lot of other amazingly colorful and special, special effects shortly after his first encounter, but with a non-understanding wife (Teri Garr), his personal life falling apart because he just can't get over WHAT HE EXPERIENCED (despite official government denials) and becomes obsessed with it, Roy hooks up with Jillian (Melinda Dillon) who shared Neary's experiences, and whose young boy was apparently abducted by the ufo's and E.T.Unlike Spielberg's later (more successful financially but much less so artistically) ""ET: The Extraterrestrial,"" Close Encounters captures the awe and wonder at the confrontation of the unknown and frighteningly unexplored.  While in ET, most of what is presented is childlike and revealed, in CE3K (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), the genius of Spielberg is more fully realized and more rewardingly subtle.  Maybe Steve was just uncorrupted by the Hollywood system, but while I like ET, Close Encounters is presented as a mystery in the most cosmic sense.  A normal American joe encounters the extraordinary.  How will he resolve this?  And what wonders await?I have always had a problem with the various versions and releases/edits of this film.  Even with deleted scenes and unseen ones however, there really is no ""filler"" here.  This was and is, Hollywood SCI-FI/FANTASY filmmaking at its best, along with George Lucas and his efforts of course.I envy those who have never experienced this movie.  I've seen it (in all its forms) more than any other film (save perhaps Apocalypse Now in its two forms), and there are parts I still MUST watch, whenever it appears on the tube.  It is a movie of mystery and frustration, of identification with the characters and that sense of wonder of exploring the unknown, and while Spielberg's ""ET"" might've been a compelling exploration of that quest to understand the wonderous unknown, this movie is even more compelling.  And appeals not to the child, but to the child within all of us, so called ""adults.""""Even if there ain't no such thing,"" Roy Neary said.The story is believable, the characters are all of us in a way, the special effects are spectacular, the wonder of it all is evident in almost every frame, the music is second to none, and this was, and remains Steven Spielberg's finest achievement."	test
94	This movie captures perfectly the claustrophobia of subsurface warfare. As the destroyers pass overhead dropping blind, killing devices the Germans submariners, unable to see their attackers, sit often in silent fear waiting for the world around them to stop exploding. This must be what the actual German U-boats went through.Fine acting and a top-quality script do nothing but enhance the powerfully understated directing. Everything that happens just seems to naturally occur. The whole thing has something of a documentary feel to it. It also has one of the great tragic endings of all time.	test
95	Usually I watch a movie for enjoyment, or laughter, or just curiosity. The newest version of &quot;Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; is so bad that was ashamed watching it. I rented it and would recommend others buying or  renting the far superior version starring Burt Lancaster and even better,  &quot;The Island of Lost Souls,&quot; with Charles Laugton as the  mysterious doctor and in an equally impressive performance, none other than  Bela Lugosi as the leader of the animal mutants. H.G. Wells rarely fails on  paper and the novel is good, but what the film makers have done is beyond  imagination. John Frankenheimer, the same director of the &quot;Mancherian  Candidate,&quot; is reponsible for directing this mess. Marlon Brando , as  Dr. Moreau, possibly gives the worse performance by an actor in a film that  I have ever seen. Covered with Number 50 sunblock, wearing buck teeth and  covering his head with what looks like a lampshade in his first scene, what  was he up to, putting on the director and playing a joke on the audience?  If studios pay actors like Brando a million dollars for dreck like this we  are in trouble folks. Val Kilmer's sleepwalking performance is not far  behind Brando's preposterous presence. It almost made me forget how good he  was in &quot;Tombstone.&quot; The great special effects wizard, Stan  Winston, wasted any creature work because of the shoddy acting and  directing. I give this version one star only because of Stan Winston's  work, and what a creative team of actors and a good director could have  done with the exoitc local, the possibilities for a good horror film in the  tradition of the previous works. As it stands, it is the worse film Brando  has ever been in and one of the worse films made by a major studio ever  made. No DVD nor wide screen showing could save this ship that sinks in  memory faster than the Titanic. Many old films are rotting and technicians  are restoring them back to their original luster. This is one film that  they should let evaporate in the archives. Save your money and buy the  previously mentioned versions, far outclassing this monumental epic,  appropriately about man's arrogance while monkeying with Mother Nature. The  movie is a true mutation, an experiment gone far far wrong.	test
96	"I knew ""The Outer Limits,"" and this, ""Virginia"", ain't no ""Outer Limits"".Two astronauts lose two minutes during a routine space walk and we, the viewers, must endure one hundred and nine minutes of pure movie-watching HELL.It's not that the stars aren't doing the best with what they've got.  Depp makes an effective is-he-or-isn't-he husband of Charlize Theron, appropriately unnerved by the creepy goings on around her.  Sadly, the duo is saddled with a less-than-thrilling script and an inexperienced director.While it's great to see character actors Blair Brown, Donna Murphy, and Joe Morton, they, too, are wasted.  Brown, an actress whose film career hasn't grown like her weight, has very little to do as the wife of Depp's new employer.  Murphy, a well-respected stage actress, has about as much screen time here as she did in last summer's blockbuster, ""Spiderman 2.""Morton is basically playing the same character, though slightly unhinged, that he played in ""Terminator 2""...or was it on TV's Smallville,""...or was it ""What Lies Beneath""?  Either way, he doesn't have to stretch his acting chops on this one.This is one time when the appetizer (the trailer) is more filling than the main entree (the film, itself)."	neg
97	Love the way this simple mom challenges her sons to something better than watching TV everyday by sending them the library. This famous surgeon with such humble beginnings is steered into his destiny through a God fearing mother. Amazing true story.	pos
98	The neighborhood teens are being killed off one by one as the man they thought was dead returns to get the ultimate revenge. And their parents can't save them now. Try to stay awake through this one. There are better  sequels and better times to be had.	neg
99	If you enjoy watching conversations between your grandparents and their friends, this movie it is for you. In 62 years of movie watching I can honestly say this is the most boring movie ever made. You will first be bored by watching the commercials that you have just paid to see. The writer of this, &quot;worst of Jack Nicholson&quot;, fiasco did us a favor by allowing us to watch the first 2 minutes that is the entire movie. The balance of which is the same as those first 2 minutes. Save your money or buy Enron stock, the entertainment is far better.	neg
